React element:
	- describes what you want to see on the screen
	- is an object representation of a DOM node
	- old JavaScript objects (used to describe how the HTML for the 	component should look — there are no methods on the object, 	just data.) with a couple of properties:
		- key
		- props
		- ref
		- type

React component:
	- is a function or a Class which optionally accepts input and	 	returns a React element.
	- A ReactComponent must have at least a render method, which 		returns a ReactElement(-tree) when invoked
